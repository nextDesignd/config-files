# Notes :
# * To apply changes to already open tmux session
#   open command mode PREFIX :, then ->
#      source-file ~/.tmux.conf
# * set/set-option command is used to configure interactions
#   options for session
# * set-window-option/setw, would be used to configure interactions
#   options related to windows
# * Can setup short-cuts that don't require PREFIX using bind-key with -n.
#   Example ->
#      bind-key -n C-r source-file ~/.tmux.conf
#   This would set up C-r to reload configuration. But would render C-r to 
#   not be seen by any underlying applcations that might use it
# * bind's option "-r" make a key repetable, that means we can use
#   PREFIX kkk to have same effect as PREFIX k PREFIX k PREFIX k


# setting the prefix from C-b to C-a
# -g means global
set -g prefix C-a

# free up Ctrl-b as prefix binding
unbind C-b

# setting the delay between prefix and command to lesser
# value, so it does not interfere with vim
set -s escape-time 1

# set the base index for windows to 1 intead of 0
set -g base-index 1

# set the base index for panes to 1 intead of 0
set -g pane-base-index 1

# setup PREFIX r to re-load configurations
# also display text "Reloaded!"
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Reloaded!"

# Ensure C-a can be send to other apps, by pressing it twice
bind C-a send-prefix

# splitting panes with | and - :
bind | split-window -h # -h : stack panes horizontally
bind - split-window -v # -v : stack panes vertically

# moving between panes with PREFIX hjkl
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# PREFIX C-h and PREFIX C-l to shift between windows
bind -r C-h select-window -t :-
bind -r C-l select-window -t :+

# resize panes with PREFIX HJKL
bind -r H resize-pane -L 5
bind -r J resize-pane -D 5
bind -r K resize-pane -U 5
bind -r L resize-pane -R 5

# to enable mouse support change off to on
set -g mouse off

# set default terminal mode to 256color mode

setw -g window-status-style fg=cyan,bg=black

# set color for active windows
